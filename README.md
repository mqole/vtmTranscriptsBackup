# NYbN Transcript project
> Sep 15 2022- Init.

I spent way too long trying to get jekyll to work on windows, so instead this repo is generated from <a href= "https://github.com/flancast90/Millidocs-Dark">flancast90's pretty dark theme</a>.

VERY much a WIP. Currently still sorting out how to make the navigation on this thing look good. Hoping to eventually support html, plaintext and epub versions of transcripts. That's definitely going to take a while though

Any suggestions, bugs, etc. shoot me a message either here or on <a href="https://mqole.tumblr.com">my tumblr</a>.
